# Caesar Chiper

Simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# Prerequisites
To compile and run this project, you need a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang.

# Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -o caesar_cipher main.cpp
```
This will create an executable file named `caesar_cipher`.

# Running the Program
To run the compiled program, use:
```sh
./caesar_cipher
```
## Input
Enter the text you want to encrypt.
Enter the shift value (an integer) for the Caesar Cipher.
## Output
The program will display:
- The encrypted text based on the provided shift value.
- The decrypted text, which should match the original input text.

# Example
```yaml
Enter the text: Hello World
Enter the shift: 3
Encrypted text: Khoor Zruog
Decrypted text: Hello World
```
